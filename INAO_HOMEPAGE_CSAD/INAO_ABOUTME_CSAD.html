My name is Kenneth Aedrianne M. Inao but you can call me <b>Ken</b>.<sup>1</sup> I was born in <i>BMMLC</i>, small clinic at Tondo.<sup>2</sup> I was held to my mother's womb for almost
			10 months and was so skinny when I came out.<sup>3</sup> When I was a child we live in Danganan St. Tondo and studied at <em>Librada Avelino Elementary School</em> at Gagalangin.<sup>4</sup> 
			My mother told me that when I attended my first class I wasn't like other children who cries and throwing tantrums.<sup>5</sup> Due to late delivery, my immune system was easily targeted by mild sickness.<sup>6</sup>
			And when I was at grade 3 I got diagnosed with dengue and was confined in <i>San Lazaro Hospital</i>.<sup>7</sup> When I was 10, we moved to <i>Balut, tondo</i> because my parents can't pay the rent anymore.<sup>8</sup>
			My parents find a small spot where we can all start again, they open a small grocery store in which where we also sleep.<sup>9</sup> Days go by, we all see the success of the store because my parents started to rent a 
			real house near the store where they worked.<sup>10</sup> I'm still attending class at the same school until I finished my grade school.<sup>11</sup> I learned few things that helps me solve things or how to get
			my life easier while I was studying.<sup>12</sup> That is <q>Whatever you do, there is always a pattern. It doesn't have to be numbers</q>.<sup>13</sup> As I stumbled on that kind of thinking, even if I was having a hard
			time understanding things I always look from the different angle for me to look at the bigger picture.<sup>14</sup> I always think that I don't have to know all the details just the important part.<sup>15</sup> <q>Choose
			between what is important and what is extra, don't blind yourself from happiness because it always comes with great price.</q><sup>16</sup> Always use your head even if its lovelife, family, friends because no matter what
			you do once they're gone, they're gone.<sup>17</sup> I never struggle letting go of people because of my mindset that time, never been too clingy or too close to anyone until I went through teenage years.<sup>18</sup>
			My mindset changed but the more I live the more I gained knowledge and wisdom.<sup>19</sup> And I thank my childhood memories for what I became today because the things I picked up on those years were everlasting.<sup>20</sup></p>

			I undergo puberty like everyone else did.<sup>3</sup> I made a lot of friends throughout this phase of my life and enjoyed being around with them.<sup>4</sup> I can still remember in my early teenage life, the day that we played in our 
			school ground after class, smiles on our faces and laughter that shows how happy we are and acting like 5-year-old children.<sup>5</sup> Being goofy and sometimes clown of the classroom,I like to tease my friends and classmates 
			just to annoy and make them laugh.<sup>6</sup> Where in photos that are taken and witnessed some of my life back then, proves how goofy and easy go lucky I was.<sup>7</sup> I also used to make funny faces in front of the camera that shows 
			how cheerful and how I enjoyed that time.<sup>8</sup> Also, there is one specific event in my life that I will never forget and consider it as my favorite timeline of this.<sup>9</sup> The time that we went out of town as a vacation and 
			went to White Beach Puerto Galera with my family and relatives.<sup>10</sup> It was fantastic, a lot of memories were made, pictures that are taken, and souvenirs that were brought home.<sup>11</sup> We did a lot of activities there, 
			we hiked to see the falls and took a picture of it, we jet skied, and we did night swimming in the beach.<sup>12</sup> As I grew older, I started to have crushes and began attracted to girls and I did have a girlfriend when I was 
			14 years old.<sup>13</sup> I never thought that we would make a great couple back then because we used to hate each other, we are always fighting and annoying one another.<sup>14</sup> Until one day, I realized that I grew fond of her, I fell 
			in love.<sup>15</sup> That is when we started being friends and eventually, being a couple.<sup>16</sup> We enjoyed and cherished each other’s company and our relationship.<sup>17</sup> We also did what other couples are doing, we watched movies together, 
			eating outside, going on a date, spending time with our friends, and the like.<sup>18</sup> However, relationship is not all about rainbows, there are always downfalls, fights, and misunderstanding arguments.<sup>19</sup> Our relationship was 
			challenged when someone tries to break us apart, we nearly broke up that time, luckily, we managed to save our relationship and continued our story.<sup>20</sup> We lasted months before we broke up, it was a mutual decision and we 
			knew that it was the best for us.<sup>21</sup> I engaged myself in academics and focus on my studies for my future.<sup>22</sup> I never regretted anything that was happened in my teenage life, good memories and bad memories does not matter; 
			in fact it helps me to what I am today.<sup>23</sup></p>

			don't drink alcohol.<sup>3</sup> Now I feel open to every kind of things that I avoided when I was a kid.<sup>4</sup> I remember my first day, I wasn't making any friends and wasn't talking to anyone.<sup>5</sup> Maybe
			because I wasn't sure if I want to make friends or not.<sup>6</sup> I feel like I don't need friends anymore.<sup>7</sup> But then there's this guy asked me about a game called <q>Mobile Legends</q>.<sup>8</sup> I wasn't sure if I should
			answer him or not.<sup>9</sup> So I nod my head and gave him a smile.<sup>10</sup> That's the moment where he keeps talking and asking me a lot of things even my life.<sup>11</sup> I wasn't entertaining him much but he keeps
			on talking until the class ended.<sup>12</sup> During our vacant I decided to go with him since I don't know much of the place.<sup>13</sup> It was my first time in <i><b>University of the East</b></i> and he was the only person I knew.<sup>14</sup> Since then
			I became talkative and made our group bigger.<sup>15</sup> They were the very person who ever gave me a gift on my birthday, I didn't even told them it was my birthday.<sup>16</sup> So I felt appreciated and I don't even
			know what to say.<sup>17</sup> Thanks to them I became a much better person.<sup>18</sup> I kept them all in my heart and cherish them all.<sup>19</sup> I went through a lot but through college but I know this is just the beggining.<sup>20</sup></p></p>
